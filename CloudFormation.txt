CloudFormation:

CloudFormation defines logical resources within templates (using YAML or JSON). The logical resource defines the WHAT, and leaves the HOW up to the CFN product. A CFN stack creates a physical resource for every logical resource - updating or deleting them as a template changes.

--> it starts with a template- yaml or json
--> contains logical resources -"what you want to create/what resources you want"
-->Templates are used to create Stacks
-->stack creates physical resource from the logic.
--> if stacks template is changed - physical resources are changes 
--> if stack is deleted- physiscal resources are deleted
-->A stack is a set of AWS resources created and managed as a single unit. When you run a CloudFormation template, it creates a stack.
