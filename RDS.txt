RDS
Relational database:
Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) is a fully managed database service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS).

-->It simplifies the process of setting up, operating, and scaling relational databases in the cloud.
**--> database cloning: db can be cloned  and it uses copy-on-write protocol so it is way faster than snapshot and restore.

**--> you can use rds proxy which allows apps to pool and share db connections established with the database
**--> proxy bd is serverless,autoscaling and highly available(mutli az).

-->Uses sql as querry language
--> DB engines maintained by AWS
    postgres
    Mysql
    MAriaDB
    Oracle
    MS SQL Server
    IBM DB2
    Aurora(AWS Proprietary database)

Advantages of using RDS vs deploying db on EC2 instance:
RDS is a managed service:
-->Automated provisioning and OS patching
-->contineous backups and restore to specific time stamp
-->monitoring dashboards
-->Read replicas for improved read performance
-->multi AZ setup for disaster recovery
-->maintenance windows for upgrades
-->scaling capability
-->storage backed on ebs


RDS storage auto scaling:
-->helps you to increase storage on your rds db
-->you have to setup maximum storage threshold
-->automatically modifies storage if :
     *free storage is less than 10%
     *low storage lasts at least 5 minutes


RDS Read replica:
-->Read replicas in RDS allow you to create one or more copies of your database for read-only purposes.
-->Replication is ASYNC, so read are eventually consistent
-->Replicas can be promoted to their own DB.
-->so to run a reporting application you can create a replica and then run the application on the replica.
-->replicas are used for read only and not for insert ,update or delete.
-->you can do replication in same zone , same region btw different AZ and also cross-region.

RDS MultiAZ(DIsaster recovery)
-->SYNC replication.
-->replica is called RDS DB Instance standby. In case of failover of master DB in zone 1, instance standby in zone 2 become the master
--> RDS DB Instance standby is not used for scaling i.e no reads and writes
-->Read replicas can be setup as MultiAZ for disaster recovery.
****-->rds can be changed from single az to multi az , by just clicking modify for the DB.
*** snapshot of db is taken and restored in the standby db. then synchronization is established between 2 databases.

Amazon Aurora:
-->its is proprietary technology from aws(not open sourced)
-->postgres and mysql are both supported by aurora
-->it is cloud optimized i.e works better on cloud 5X of mysql and 3X of postgres.
-->aurora storage automatillacy increases by 10gb upto 128tb
-->can have upto 15 read replicas with autoscaling.
--> failover of aurora is instantaneous
-->cost 20% more than other db engines
-->on read replicas we have reader endpoint which can balance load between read replicas

Features of aurora:
-->automatic failover
-->backup and recovery
-->isolation and security
-->industry compliance
-->advanced monitoring
-->routine maintenance
***-->backtrack: restores data at any point of time without using backups

Aurora backups:
Automated backups:
-->1 to 35 days (cannit be disabled)
-->ability to restore to a point
Manual backups: 
--> manually triggered by users
-->retention as long as user wants.


RDS backups:
Automated backups:
-->daily full backup
-->transaction logs are backed every 5min.
-->ability to restore to a point 
-->1 to 35 days of retention,set 0 to disable auto backups
Manual backups: 
--> manually triggered by users
-->retention as long as user wants.

note: in a stopped rds database , you would pay for the storage.
and if you plan to stop it for a long time, take a snap shot and restore instead.

RDS AND AURORA RESTORE OPTIONS:both backups create a new database when recovered
--> create a backup of your database (using percona xtraBackup in MYSQL Aurora)
-->store it in s3 
-->restore it into a new RDS instance running databases engines(mysql or aurora)

RDS AND AURORA SECURITY :
--> at rest encryption
-->In-flight encryption
-->IAM authentication: IAM role to connect
-->security groups
--> no ssh available(except for rds custom)
-->audit logs can be sent oto cloudwatch


Amazon elastic cache:
--> Elastic cache is to get managed redis or memcached
-->caches are in memory databases with high performance and low latency.
-->helps reduce load off the databases 
--> using elastiCache involves heavy application code changes.
 //look into redis vs Memcached?????///
