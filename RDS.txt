RDS
Relational database:
Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) is a fully managed database service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS).

-->It simplifies the process of setting up, operating, and scaling relational databases in the cloud.
-->Uses sql as querry language
--> DB engines maintained by AWS
    postgres
    Mysql
    MAriaDB
    Oracle
    MS SQL Server
    IBM DB2
    Aurora(AWS Proprietary database)

Advantages of using RDS vs deploying db on EC2 instance:
RDS is a managed service:
-->Automated provisioning and OS patching
-->contineous backups and restore to specific time stamp
-->monitoring dashboards
-->Read replicas for improved read performance
-->multi AZ setup for disaster recovery
-->maintenance windows for upgrades
-->scaling capability
-->storage backed on ebs


RDS storage auto scaling:
-->helps you to increase storage on your rds db
-->you have to setup maximum storage threshold
-->automatically modifies storage if :
     *free storage is less than 10%
     *low storage lasts at least 5 minutes


RDS Read replica:
-->Read replicas in RDS allow you to create one or more copies of your database for read-only purposes.
-->Replication is ASYNC, so read are eventually consistent
-->Replicas can be promoted to their own DB.
-->so to run a reporting application you can create a replica and then run the application on the replica.
-->replicas are used for read only and not for insert ,update or delete.
-->you can do replication in same zone , same region btw different AZ and also cross-region.

RDS MultiAZ(DIsaster recovery)
-->SYNC replication.
-->replica is called RDS DB Instance standby. In case of failover of master DB in zone 1, instance standby in zone 2 become the master
--> RDS DB Instance standby is not used for scaling i.e no reads and writes
-->Read replicas can be setup as MultiAZ for disaster recovery.
****-->rds can be changed from single az to multi az , by just clicking modify for the DB.
*** snapshot of db is taken and restored in the standby db. then synchronization is established between 2 databases.

Amazon Aurora:
-->its is proprietary technology from aws(not open sourced)
-->postgres and mysql are both supported by aurora
-->it is cloud optimized i.e works better on cloud 5X of mysql and 3X of postgres.
-->aurora storage automatillacy increases by 10gb upto 128tb
-->can have upto 15 read replicas with autoscaling.
--> failover of aurora is instantaneous
-->cost 20% more than other db engines
-->on read replicas we have reader endpoint which can balance load between read replicas
Features of aurora:
-->automatic failover
-->backup and recovery
-->isolation and security
-->industry compliance
-->advanced monitoring
-->routine maintenance
***-->backtrack: restores data at any point of time without using backups
