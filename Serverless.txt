serverless :Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and Cognito work

A list of serverless functions in aws:
lambda,dynamo db , cognito , api gateway , s3 , sns,sqs,kinesis data firehose
aurora serverless , step functions , FArgate (ECS)

The SA exam is pretty lightweight on the details on Serverless services.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

LAMBDA: AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service provided by AWS

-->It allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers, paying only for the compute time consumed by your function.

briefly:
--> virtual functions - no server to be managed
-->limited bytime - short executions(15min generally)
-->run in demand(when not used lambda wont run)
--> scaling is automated
-->pay per request and compute time
-->can be integrated with whole aws services
-->easyly monitored by cloudwatch
-->increasing RAM also improves CPU and network
-->languages supported : nodejs ,python , java(java 8) , c# , golang , Ruby ,custom runtime api
-->(my understanding): we create functions in lambda which are nothing but a logical code and these functions are triggered by various aws resources.

(look into it)--> lambda container images:
     -> the container image must implement lambda runtime API
     ->ecs/fargate is preferred for running Arbitrary Docker Images

 --> Lambda SnapStart: improves your Lambda function performance upto 10X for java 11 and above with no extra cost
