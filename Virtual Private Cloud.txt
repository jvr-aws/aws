Virtual Private Cloud


->Amazon VPC or Amazon Virtual Private Cloud is a service that allows its users to launch their virtual machines in a protected as well as isolated virtual environment defined by them.

->VPC enables us to select the virtual address of our private cloud and we can also define all the sub-constituents of the VPC like subnet, subnet mask, availability zone, etc on our own. 

->We can place the necessary resources and manage access to those resources in the VPC, a private area of Amazon that we control.
->You can launch AWS resources into a defined virtual network using Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC).
/16 user-defined address space maximum (65,536 addresses)

->To reduce traffic, the subnet will divide the big network into smaller, connected networks. Up to /16, 200 user-defined subnets.

NOTE :{A Subnet is short for Subnetwork. It is a logical subdivision of an IP network.}

->Route Tables are mainly used to Define the protocol for traffic routing between the subnets.

NOTE :{A Router is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer network. 
This device is usually connected to two or more different networks.}

NOTE :{A routing table is a set of rules, often viewed in table format, that is used to determine where data packets traveling over an Internet Protocol (IP) network will be directed. All IP-enabled devices, including routers and switches, use routing tables.}

NOTE :{Subnet Mask: The mask that is used to match a destination IP address to the network ID.}

->Network Access Control Lists (NACL) for VPC serve as a firewall by managing both inbound and outbound rules. There will be a default NACL for each VPC that cannot be deleted.

NOTE :{Security groups and NACL both act as virtual firewalls which control the traffic from Inbound and Outbound of the resources.}
NOTE :{Security groups are virtual shields or protectors of EC2 instances. Unless specifically allowed By default all Inbound traffic is blocked whereas all Outbound traffic is allowed from the Instance.}
NOTE :{In the security groups, we cannot block a specific IP address because it doesn’t have any DENY rule just like ALLOW rule. To achieve this we can make use of NACL.}
NOTE :{Here are some Limitations of Security Groups in AWS:
      For a specific Security Group, the maximum Inbound and Outbound rules is 60
      For any region the default limit of security groups is 2,500 and it can be extended 10,000 Maximum for any further extension we have to do service requests.
      Cannot block the DNS traffic or the traffic from the route 53.
      Cannot be applied to the multiple VPCs.}

NOTE: {Network Access Control List is also a virtual firewall for subnets, which controls the Inbound and Outbound traffic of Subnets. After the creation of VPC, a Default NACL will be associated and allow all Inbound and Outbound Traffic.}

-->Difference between security group and NACL?
NACL
Network Access Control List that helps provide a layer of security to the amazon web services. There are two kinds of NACL- Customized and default.
Multiple subnets can be bound with a single NACL, but one subnet can be bound with a single NACL only, at a time
NACL can be understood as the firewall or protection for the subnet.
These are stateless, meaning any change applied to an incoming rule isn’t automatically applied to an outgoing rule.
Example: If a request comes through port 80, it should be explicitly indicated that its outgoing response would be the same port 80.
NACL can be used to support as well as deny rules. Denial of rules can be explicitly mentioned, so that when the layer sees a specific IP address, it blocks connecting to it.
It is considered to be the second layer of defence, which helps protect AWS stack. It is an optional layer for VPC, which adds another security layer to the amazon service.

Security Group
A security group has to be explicitly assigned to an instance; it doesn’t associate itself to a subnet.
Security groups are associated with an instance of a service. It can be associated with one or more security groups which has been created by the user.
Security group can be understood as a firewall to protect EC2 instances.
These are stateful, which means any changes which are applied to an incoming rule is automatically applied to a rule which is outgoing.
Example: If the incoming port of a request is 80, the outgoing response of that request is also 80 (it is opened automatically) by default.
They support rules only, and the default behaviour is denial of all rules.  Every VPC can belong to different security groups.
It is considered to be the first defence layer that helps protect the Amazon Web Services infrastructure.

Note: {EC2 instance will be deployed in the VPC in a particular subnet so when there is incoming traffic first the traffic must be matched with NACL then it will be routed to security groups other wise the traffic will be denied at the subnet level traffic will not reach the application.}

Internet Gateway (IGW) will make it possible to link the resources in the VPC to the Internet.{0.0.0.0\0}

Network Address Translation (NAT) will enable the connection between the private subnet and the internet.

Note: {Network Address Translation (NAT) is a process in which one or more local IP address is translated into one or more Global IP address and vice versa in order to provide Internet access to the local hosts.}
Note: { Also, it does the translation of port numbers i.e. masks the port number of the host with another port number, in the packet that will be routed to the destination. It then makes the corresponding entries of IP address and port number in the NAT table. NAT generally operates on a router or firewall. }

What difference between IGW & NAT Gateway ?

Internet Gateway
Connects a VPC to the internet
Acts as a virtual router between a VPC and the internet
Required for resources within a VPC to be accessible from the internet
Instances within a public subnet must have public IP addresses to communicate with the internet
Used for hosting publicly accessible resources like web servers

NAT Gateway
Enables outbound traffic from a private subnet to the internet
Translates private IP addresses of instances to public IP addresses
Used when resources within a private subnet require internet access but should not be directly accessible from the internet
Instances within a private subnet can have private IP addresses
Used for instances that need to access the internet for updates or data retrieval


Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) Fundamentals
If the subnet has internet access then it is called PublicSubnet.
If the subnet doesn’t have internet access then it is called PrivateSubnet.
A subnet must reside entirely within one Availability Zone. 
Access between instances is managed by VPC Security Groups for both inbound and outgoing traffic (EC2 Security Groups can only define inbound rules).
We can specify Subnet IP Routing with the aid of the Route Table.
If a server/instance which is in a private subnet wants to reach the internet then it must have NAT in a public subnet.


Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) is a method of IP address allocation and IP routing that allows for more efficient use of IP addresses.

For example, an IP address of 192.168.1.0 with a prefix length of 24 would be represented as 192.168.1.0/24. This notation indicates that the first 24 bits of the IP address are the network prefix and the remaining 8 bits are the host identifier.

Advantages of the Traditional Class-Based Addressing System of CIDR(Classless Inter Domain Routing ):
1)Efficient use of IP addresses
2)Flexibility: CIDR allows for more flexible IP address allocation
3)Reduced administrative overhead: by allowing for the allocation and routing of IP addresses in a more efficient and flexible way.

Advantages of CIDR: Efficient use of IP addresses,Flexibility,Better routing.
Disadvantages of CIDR: Complexity,Compatibility issues

Overall, CIDR is a useful and efficient method of IP address allocation and routing.

VPC peering can establish the connection between two Virtual Private Clouds which enables you to route the traffic between two VPCs using the IP address. 
it can connect vpc in differernt regions and accounts


What is Bastion Host?
A Bastion host is a special-purpose server or an instance that is used to configure to work against the attacks or threats. It is also known as the ‘jump box’ that acts like a proxy server and allows the client machines to connect to the remote server.

NAT INSTANCE
A NAT instance provides network address translation (NAT). You can use a NAT instance to allow resources in a private subnet to communicate with destinations outside the virtual private cloud (VPC), such as the internet or an on-premises network.

The NAT instance must have internet access, 
-->so it must be in a public subnet 
-->it should have an elastic ip
--> route table in private subnet must be configured to route traffic to route table.


To get started with NAT instances, create a NAT AMI, create a security group for the NAT instance, and launch the NAT instance into your VPC.

NAT GATEWAY:
-->NAT Gateways allow instances in private subnets to communicate with the internet, AWS services, or external endpoints,
-->NAT Gateways have their own public IP addresses and are managed by AWS, so you don't need to configure or manage the underlying infrastructure.
-->NAT Gateways can automatically scale up to handle higher traffic volumes
-->NAT instances and gateways both are bound to the availability zone.

Vpc endpoints:
Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) endpoints allow you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and endpoints without requiring internet gateways, NAT devices, VPN connections, or direct peering

-->These are powered by AWS PrivateLink and provide private connectivity to AWS services 

TYPES OF ENDPOINTS
1)Gateway Endpoints: These allow you to privately connect your VPC to Amazon S3 and DynamoDB . cost is free

2)Interface Endpoints: These are powered by AWS PrivateLink and provide private connectivity via Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs). Examples include Amazon EC2, Amazon SNS, and Amazon SQS.

3)Gateway Load Balancer Endpoints: These endpoints allow you to privately connect your VPC to Network Load Balancers (NLBs) within your VPC.

VPC FLOW LOGS:
VPC Flow Logs is a feature provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows you to capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). 

A Direct Connect Gateway is an AWS networking feature that enables you to connect multiple Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) distributed across different AWS Regions to your on-premises network via AWS Direct Connect.
--> dedicated direct connect - 1 to 10 gbps speed
-->hosted direct connect - 50mbps,500mbps, upto 10gbps

An AWS Transit Gateway is a highly scalable and centralized hub that enables you to connect multiple Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs), on-premises networks, and AWS Direct Connect gateways, making it easier to build and manage large-scale networks in the cloud. 

Transit Gateway is suitable for connecting multiple VPCs and on-premises networks within and across different AWS Regions, supporting transitive routing and hub-and-spoke topology. Direct Connect Gateway, on the other hand, is designed specifically for connecting multiple VPCs within the same AWS Region to an on-premises network via AWS Direct Connect, without supporting transitive routing.
note : it supports ip multicast (buttify)

Transitive Routing:

Transit Gateway: Supports transitive routing, allowing traffic to flow between connected VPCs and on-premises networks without additional peering connections. It simplifies network design and enhances connectivity between distributed resources.
Direct Connect Gateway: Does not support transitive routing. Traffic between VPCs connected via Direct Connect Gateway must traverse your on-premises network to reach each other.


****aws site to site gateway:
It is a vpn connection so it travels in public internet but encrypted.

we need the following to establist s2sVPN connection:
1)virtual private gateway(VGW)at vpc
2)Customer gateway at datacenters(customer)
3)set up route tables for traffic flow.

***AWS Direct Connect
AWS Direct Connect provides a dedicated, private connection between an on-premises data center, office, or colocation facility and AWS.
--> flexible bandwidth options ranging from 50 Mbps to 100 Gbps,
--> can access public(s3) and private(ec2) aws resources
--> its a private connection

Direct connect gateway:
Direct Connect Gateway allows you to connect multiple Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) within the same AWS Region to your on-premises network via a single Direct Connect connection.

1)dedicated direct connect: 1,10,100gbps speed
-->physical ethernet port dedicated to customer
-->request is made to aws first and then completed by aws direct connect partners

2)hosted direct connection:50,500mbps upto 10 gbps speed
-->requests are made via aws direct connect partners
both connections take 1 month to establish

Direct Connect provides a dedicated, private connection between your on-premises network and AWS, while Direct Connect Gateway allows you to connect multiple VPCs within the same AWS Region to your on-premises network via a single Direct Connect connection, facilitating hub-and-spoke connectivity and transit routing.

direct connect is not encrypted but private.
to make it encrypted you can use aws direct connect + vpn .
you can set up a backup connection to the direct connection via a direct connect(expensive) and site to site vpn connection(cheap)
